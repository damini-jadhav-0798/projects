    <h2>The Taj Mahal of Agra</h2>

  </div>

  <div class="para1">
    <p>Perhaps India's most recognizable building, the Taj Mahal is also the world's most famous testimony to the power
      of love. Named after Mumtaz Mahal, the favorite wife of Emperor Shah Jahan, this most beautiful of mausoleums was
      begun upon her death in 1631 and took 20,000 workmen until 1648 to complete.The Taj Mahal is largely constructed
      of white marble decorated with delicate inlaid floral patterns and precious and semi-precious stones such as jade,
      lapis lazuli, diamonds, and mother of pearl.</p>

    <h2>The Holy City of Varanasi</h2>

  </div>

  <div class="para2">
    <p>A major pilgrimage center for Hindus, the holy city of Varanasi has long been associated with the mighty Ganges
      River, one of the faith's most important religious symbols. Dating back to the 8th century BC, Varanasi is one of
      the oldest still inhabited cities in the world.It offers many reasons to visit, not least of them the chance to
      explore the Old Quarter adjacent to the Ganges where you'll find the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, built in 1780 (the
      New Vishwanath Temple with its seven separate temples is also of interest).</p>

    <h2>The Golden Temple of Amritsar</h2>


  </div>

  <div class="para3">
    <p>Founded in 1577 by Ram Das, Amritsar is an important hub of Sikh history and culture. The main attraction here is
      Harmandir Sahib, opened in 1604 and still often referred to as the Golden Temple for its beautiful gold
      decoration. The holiest of India's many Sikh shrines (it also attracts many Hindus and people of other faiths),
      the temple was built in a blend of Hindu and Islamic styles, its lower marble section featuring such flourishes as
      ornate inlaid floral and animal motifs, while the large golden dome represents a lotus flower, a symbol of purity
      to Sikhs.</p>
